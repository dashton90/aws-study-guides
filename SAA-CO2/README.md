## Elastic Block Store (EBS)
---
An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive.

* There are five types of EBS storage:
    * General Purpose SSD (gp2, and gp3)
    * Provisioned IOPS SSD, built for  (io1, io2, and io2 block express)
    * Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
    * Cold HDD (sc1)
    * Magnetic (standard)

† Maximum IOPS and throughput are guaranteed only on Instances built on the Nitro System provisioned with more than 32,000 IOPS



Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
==
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances. Targets can be in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).



Amazon Cognito
==
The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools.
